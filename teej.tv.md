About Me:
- Although I'm not a huge fan of the term "Content Creator" I have recently gone full-time on making content. You can find all the links below for that.

I'm currently working on a course for [boot.dev](boot.dev/teej) which you can read more about here: [[C Course Overview]].

Links in Bio:
- [teej_dv](https://youtube.com/@teej_dv): Primary channel with coherent content
- [teej_daily](https://youtube.com/@teej_daily): Secondary channel with the results from stream.
- [𝕏 dot com](https://x.com/teej_dv): Only serious posts here
- [twitch.tv/teej_dv](https://twitch.tv/teej_dv): Yes, I stream, btw
- [github](https://github.com/tjdevries): Neovim core, btw

Best place to get ahold of me is probably in my discord. You can join here: [teej-discord](https://discord.gg/SMhZJv5TSe)

Thanks for checking out the site :)
